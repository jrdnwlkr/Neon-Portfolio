# Neon Portfolio
This is my submission for the second homework assignment.

## Intro
The first section is where the user is presented with two options. The user can choose to view my work or to contact me. The text for each option is linked to a place further down on the page.

## Work
The workd section features three peices of work. The best peice of work is larger than the others.

## Contact
The contact section is at the bottom. The user is able to click the 'email me' link to open up the default mail application on their device and send me a message.

## Other Features
The website is fully responsive, contains a linked div, and css variables for the color palette.

# Thank you!
